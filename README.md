---Docker and Portainer Installation---

After running the "install.sh" script, follow these steps manually:

Access Portainer by opening a web browser and navigating to http://<your_system's_IPv4_address>:9000.
Complete the initial setup by creating an admin user, setting up the environment, and connecting Portainer to your Docker instance.

Either use the Admin user to make an API Key or create a new user (preferred).
Once your logged in with that user click on the username and arrow on the top right.  Go to my account.  At the middle of the page you will see "Access tokens".  Create one with " add access token" button on the right.
Put a description in and click "add access token".  This will display your Access Token.

COPY THIS ACCESS TOKEN YOU WILL NOT SEE IT AGAIN.  IF YOU LOSE IT YOU WILL NEED TO MAKE ANOTHER ONE.
